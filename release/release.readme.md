Welcome to Self
===============

You have just downloaded either a .dmg file (for MacOS) or a .zip file (for Linux).

This file contains three .snap files, which are snapshots of already built Self worlds. It also contains the Self virtual machine for running Self code.

The three .snap files are:

core.snap - this file contains a headless, command line only Self world.
morphic.snap - this is the most used standard snapshot with the morphic development/gui framework.
kitchensink.snap - this has the morphic framework together this some extra applications.

Installation
------------

On MacOS, drag the Self Control app to the Applications folder. Look under the application menu to install the vm for use on the command line.

On Linux, put the vm binary somewhere on your path. 

Running
-------

On MacOS, double click the Self Control app, or start a .snap file from the command line as for Linux.

On Linux, you can start a snapshot by:

> Self -s /path/to/the.snap
