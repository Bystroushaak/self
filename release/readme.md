# Release Creation

This directory contains scripts to build and package the VM, Controller and standard snapshots for Linux and OS X for use in releasing the Self distribution.

The top level script is `buildRelease.sh`

The environment assumes that you are running on a recent OS X, with XCode installed, a 10.8 or earlier SDK, and docker.
